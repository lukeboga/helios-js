After careful consideration, I believe the most logical starting point is updating the core types and interfaces, as this will establish the foundation for all subsequent work. A well-designed type system will make implementing the pattern combination architecture and enhanced pattern matching more straightforward and less prone to errors.

# Comprehensive Implementation Schedule

## Phase 1: Core Foundation and Type System
1. **Update `types.ts`**
   - Enhance the `RecurrenceOptions` interface to support tracking of set properties
   - Create `PatternResult` interface for handling partial matches
   - Define `PatternCombiner` interface for pattern combination
   - Update `TransformerConfig` to support the new pattern matching options
   - **✅ DONE**: Added support for both legacy and new pattern handler interfaces through adapter pattern

2. **Update `errors.ts`**
   - Add new error types for pattern combination
   - Create validation-related error types

3. **Update `constants.ts`**
   - Expand pattern constants to support synonyms and variations
   - Add constants for pattern combination priorities
   - Define standard conjunction terms

## Phase 2: Pattern Handling Infrastructure
4. **Create `patterns/splitter.ts`**
   - Implement pattern splitting for conjunctions
   - Add protection for special phrases during splitting
   - **✅ DONE**: Implemented with hybrid approach for protected phrases

5. **Create `patterns/combiner.ts`**
   - Implement the pattern combination engine
   - Add conflict resolution strategies
   - Create utility functions for merging pattern results
   - **✅ DONE**: Implemented with support for combining pattern results

6. **Update `transformer.ts`**
   - Modify to support the new pattern combination framework
   - Integrate with pattern splitter
   - Update to handle partial matches
   - **✅ DONE**: Added hybrid transformation approach that:
     - Splits complex patterns using the splitter
     - Processes each sub-pattern individually
     - Combines results using the combiner
     - Falls back to traditional approach when needed

## Phase 3: Enhanced Pattern Handlers
7. **Update `patterns/utils.ts`**
   - Add utilities for flexible pattern matching
   - Implement synonym recognition
   - Add fuzzy matching for common terms

8. **Update and Create Pattern Handlers**
   - Update `patterns/frequency.ts` to support partial matches and return `PatternResult`
   - Update `patterns/interval.ts` with the same enhancements
   - Update `patterns/dayOfWeek.ts` to support flexible matching
   - **✅ DONE**: Created `patterns/dayOfMonth.ts` as a new pattern handler using the new interface:
     - Supports numeric ordinals (1st, 2nd, etc.)
     - Supports word ordinals (first, second, etc.)
     - Integrates with the hybrid transformer

9. **Create `patterns/untilDate.ts`**
   - Implement pattern handler for end date expressions
   - Add support for date parsing from natural language

## Phase 4: API and Integration
10. **Update `normalizer.ts`**
    - Enhance text normalization for better pattern matching
    - Add support for handling special characters and formats

11. **Update `index.ts`**
    - Remove the redundant `endDate` parameter
    - Update public API to reflect the new architecture
    - Add pattern validation functions

12. **Create Testing Scripts**
    - Implement simple Node.js scripts to validate functionality
    - Test various pattern combinations
    - **✅ DONE**: Added test suite for `dayOfMonth` pattern handler
    - Add tests for hybrid pattern handling approach

## Phase 5: Documentation and Refinement
13. **Add Pattern Documentation**
    - Document supported patterns
    - Create examples for various use cases
    - Add documentation for hybrid pattern handling approach

14. **Performance Optimization**
    - Optimize regular expressions
    - Add caching for repeated patterns

## New Hybrid Architecture Overview

We've implemented a novel hybrid approach for pattern handling that provides several advantages:

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Legacy pattern handlers continue to work with no changes
   - New pattern handlers can use the improved interface

2. **Pattern Splitting**
   - Complex patterns like "Monday and Friday" are split into simpler sub-patterns
   - Special phrases are protected from incorrect splitting

3. **Pattern Combination**
   - Sub-patterns are processed individually and then combined
   - Handles conflicts between pattern results intelligently

4. **Graceful Fallback**
   - If advanced processing fails, falls back to traditional approach
   - Ensures robust handling of all pattern types

This approach allows us to incrementally improve the pattern handling system while maintaining compatibility with existing code. It also enables more sophisticated handling of complex patterns and improves the overall user experience.

Let's begin with updating the `types.ts` file to establish our new type system and foundation for the enhanced pattern matching and combination capabilities.
