Since the project hasn't been published yet, we have an excellent opportunity to streamline the codebase by removing the legacy code without worrying about backward compatibility. This will reduce maintenance overhead, simplify the code, and create a cleaner foundation moving forward.

To accomplish this effectively while adhering to the guiding principles from `ai/wp-001/000-guiding-principles.md`, I recommend a methodical approach:

## Analysis of Legacy Code to Remove

1. **Public API Simplification**:
   - Remove the redundant `endDate` parameter from `naturalLanguageToRRule` and `createRRule` functions
   - Remove the backward compatibility function `createRRuleWithEndDate`
   - Ensure API functions accept only the new approach parameters

2. **Adapter Patterns**:
   - Identify and remove adapter functions like `processPatternWithAdapter` that bridge old and new approaches
   - Clean up transformer code that handles both old and new pattern handler APIs

3. **Legacy Pattern Implementations**:
   - Ensure all pattern handlers use the new style that returns `PatternResult` objects
   - Remove code that supports both approaches in parallel
   - Remove any dual-checking in the transformer pipeline

4. **Documentation Cleanup**:
   - Update function documentation to reflect the simplified approach
   - Remove mentions of legacy methods in comments

## Implementation Strategy

To implement these changes safely and thoroughly, I recommend:

1. **Systematic Identification**:
   - Search for specific code patterns that indicate legacy support
   - Look for conditional branching between old/new approaches
   - Identify try/catch blocks that fall back to legacy implementations

2. **File-by-File Review**:
   - Start with the public API in `index.ts`
   - Then proceed to `transformer.ts` where most bridging logic resides
   - Continue through pattern handlers and utility functions
   - Finish with types, constants, and other supporting files

3. **Incremental Testing**:
   - After updating each file, ensure core functionality remains intact
   - Develop simple test scripts to validate changes

4. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - As legacy code is removed, enhance remaining code clarity
   - Add improved documentation highlighting the simplified approach
   - Ensure remaining code follows DRY principles and is well-structured

## Specific Files to Update

Based on the codebase, here are the specific areas that will need attention:

1. **index.ts**: 
   - Remove `createRRuleWithEndDate` function
   - Remove `endDate` parameter from function signatures
   - Simplify option-converting code

2. **transformer.ts**:
   - Remove `processPatternWithAdapter` function
   - Simplify or remove `processTraditional` if it only exists for legacy support
   - Remove branching logic between old/new pattern handler styles

3. **Pattern handlers**:
   - Ensure all handlers use the new `PatternResult` approach exclusively
   - Remove any legacy implementation support
   - Standardize APIs across all pattern handlers

4. **types.ts**:
   - Remove types that only supported the dual-mode approach
   - Simplify interfaces that accommodated legacy patterns

This approach ensures high code quality and readability through careful, systematic removal of unnecessary code while maintaining functional integrity and comprehensive documentation.

Would you like me to start with updating the `index.ts` file to implement these changes first?
