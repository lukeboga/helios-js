# Helios-JS Research

This directory contains research materials, analyses, and investigations for the Helios-JS natural language recurrence pattern parser.

## Directory Structure

```
research/
├── nlp-analysis/            # Natural language processing research
│   └── plural-day-names.md  # Analysis of handling pluralized day names
├── performance/             # Performance benchmarks and optimizations
├── requirements/            # User needs and feature requirements analysis
├── implementation-options/  # Technical implementation alternatives
└── README.md               # This file
```

## Purpose

The research folder serves as a repository for:

1. **Problem explorations** before implementation
2. **Alternative approaches** to solving technical challenges
3. **Language analysis** for natural language processing features
4. **Performance benchmarks** and optimization research
5. **User patterns** and requirements gathering

## Usage Guidelines

- Research documents should be written in Markdown format
- Include references to academic papers, industry standards, or other resources when applicable
- Document both the problem and potential solutions
- When applicable, include code samples, benchmarks, or diagrams to illustrate concepts
- Each significant research topic should have its own file
- Group related research under appropriate subdirectories

## Relationship to Implementation

Research in this directory should inform implementation decisions but does not constitute implementation plans. After research is complete and a direction is chosen:

1. Create implementation plans in the `ai/` directory
2. Reference the relevant research document(s)
3. Update documentation in the `docs/` directory as needed
