# Helios-JS Planning

This directory contains all planning-related materials for the Helios-JS project, including research analysis and implementation plans.

## Planning Workflow

The typical workflow for Helios-JS development follows these steps:

1. **Research Phase**
   - Identify problems or feature needs
   - Explore and analyze alternatives in the `research/` directory
   - Document findings and recommendations

2. **Implementation Planning Phase**
   - Once research is complete and a direction is chosen
   - Create detailed implementation plans in the `implementation/` directory
   - Include specific steps, code changes, and test strategies

3. **Development Phase**
   - Implement the planned changes in the codebase
   - Reference the implementation plan during development
   - Update plans if discoveries during implementation necessitate changes

## Research vs. Implementation Plans

**Research documents** (`research/`):
- Exploratory in nature
- Consider multiple alternatives
- Provide analysis of pros and cons
- End with recommendations but don't specify exact implementation steps

**Implementation plans** (`implementation/`):
- Prescriptive and specific
- Contain concrete steps to implement a chosen approach
- Include specific files to modify and how
- Outline testing strategies
- May include code snippets or pseudocode

## Document Formats

Both research documents and implementation plans should:
- Be written in Markdown format
- Include a descriptive title
- Add publication and last modified dates
- Have a table of contents
- Include clear sections
- Reference related documents when applicable

## Naming Conventions

- Research documents: `topic-name.md` (e.g., `plural-day-names.md`)
- Implementation plans: `[yyyy-mm-dd]-feature-name.md` (e.g., `2023-03-28-plural-day-handling.md`)
