# Documentation Process Guide

> **Change Log**:  
> - [April 2025]: Initial documentation process guide created as part of [DOC-003] enhancement

## Overview

This guide outlines the documentation process for the HeliosJS project. It establishes the requirements, standards, and workflows for keeping documentation synchronized with code changes.

## Core Principles

1. **Documentation-Code Synchronization**: Documentation must accurately reflect the current state of the codebase at all times.
2. **Documentation as Part of Implementation**: Documentation updates are considered part of the implementation process, not an afterthought.
3. **Technical Accuracy**: Documentation must be technically accurate, with verified code examples.
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Documentation should be structured from simple to complex, accommodating both beginners and experts.

## Documentation Update Requirements

### When Documentation Updates Are Required

Documentation updates are required whenever:

1. **API Changes**: Public API functions, parameters, return types, or behavior changes
2. **Interface Changes**: Changes to interfaces, types, or other structures
3. **Behavior Changes**: Changes to how components or functions behave
4. **New Features**: Addition of new functionality
5. **Deprecations**: Marking features as deprecated
6. **Implementation Changes**: Significant changes to implementation that users or contributors should be aware of

### Types of Documentation Updates

1. **API Reference Updates**: Updates to function signatures, parameters, return types
2. **Examples Updates**: Updates to code examples to reflect current implementation
3. **Concept Documentation**: Updates to explanations of concepts or architecture
4. **Tutorials/Guides**: Updates to step-by-step instructions
5. **Internal Documentation**: Updates to contributor-focused documentation

## Documentation Workflow

### 1. Identify Documentation Impact

For each code change, identify:
- Which documentation files are affected
- What specific sections need updates
- What new documentation may be needed

This assessment must be included in the **Documentation Impact** section of the PR template.

### 2. Update Documentation in the Same PR

Whenever possible, documentation updates should be included in the same PR as the code changes. This ensures:
- Documentation and code stay synchronized
- Reviewers can verify documentation accuracy alongside code
- Users have accurate documentation as soon as new code is released

### 3. Documentation Review

Documentation updates should be reviewed for:
- Technical accuracy
- Clarity and completeness
- Consistent terminology
- Proper formatting
- Working code examples

### 4. Documentation Testing

Code examples in documentation should be tested to verify they work as described. Methods for testing include:
- Manual verification
- Extracting examples into test files
- Automated documentation tests (future enhancement)

## Documentation Standards

### File Organization

- Public API documentation in `docs/public/`
- Developer/contributor documentation in `docs/development/`
- README.md as the entry point for documentation

### Structure and Formatting

- Use Markdown for all documentation
- Include a change log at the top of each file
- Use consistent heading levels (H1 for title, H2 for major sections)
- Include a table of contents for longer documents
- Use syntax highlighting for code blocks with the appropriate language

### Code Examples

- All code examples must be technically accurate and tested
- Include TypeScript type annotations in examples
- Provide complete, runnable examples where appropriate
- Include expected output as comments
- Follow project code style in examples

### Terminology

- Use consistent terminology as defined in the project glossary
- Explain technical terms on first use
- Use the same naming conventions as the codebase

## Documentation Validation

In the future, we plan to implement automated documentation validation checks:
- Code example validation
- Link validation
- Terminology consistency checking
- Documentation coverage metrics

Until automated validation is available, manual validation is required as part of the review process.

## Documentation Issue Tracking

Documentation issues should be tracked in the issue tracker with:
- The "documentation" label
- Clear description of what needs to be updated
- Reference to related code changes or issues

## Conclusion

Following this documentation process ensures that HeliosJS documentation remains accurate, comprehensive, and valuable to both users and contributors. Documentation is a critical part of the project, and maintaining high-quality documentation is everyone's responsibility.
